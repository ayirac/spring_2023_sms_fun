Dad was a scientist, an engineer working for the space station. Mom worked in pharmaceuticals. Their house was on a hill, and they were going about their day, just like any ordinary day. A meteor had been brought to attention a few years ago and dad and his co-workers have been on meteor watch because one stray meteor is heading towards Earth. News of the meteor attracted attention, news anchors would give occasional updates of the meteor, while small groups around the world have exclaimed that the end is near. Majority of the population were not worried and continued living their life. Both parents leave to go to work and the player is left alone, on the weekend. The teen checks the news, and the news anchor alerts everyone with an important broadcast: “Incoming on Meteor watch, the meteor is directly heading to Earth and is traveling at an indescribable speed. Today is the day that the end is near. During the time of despair, the teenager has not prepared for this moment to come. On the bright side, the parents have prepared, due to their bunker mentality and paranoia. A few years ago, Dad showed the teenager a prototype aircraft, along with supplies for a future voyage into space. The teen decided to risk using the prototype aircraft, rather than doing nothing and waiting for the inevitable. ",

The aircraft had enough fuel to send the teenager into space and with the risk of the prototype falling apart, was able to survive the travel. Suddenly, the force of the aircraft changed, and the aircraft had lost control, jostling the teenager in the cabin and a loud clang came from the aircraft, along with a loud thud from the teen. Movement has stopped, curiosity grew. The teen notices a suit in the aircraft and wears it. The suit was a prototype with the aircraft, allowing the user to communicate to aliens, and translate the teenager’s language into any alien language. There were modifications to the suit, such as a general map layout and storage for inventory. More modifications can be added, but the current modifications mentioned is what the teen has for the suit. The teen anxiously opens the aircraft door. A spectacle view of the sky and its vast emptiness with stars. In awe, the expression fades into confusion and despair because the aircraft is destroyed, along with being stranded on a planet with no awareness or having any familiarity of what Earth has.",

He made gadgets and one of the major accomplishments he made was a teleportation device to teleport him back home or anywhere within the planet. Y'Xor's homeland was invaded by another alien faction and during the time, he had a family. The alien faction were mercenaries and stole one of Y'Xor's inventions, which happened to be the teleport device. Since the mercenaries were ruthless, they went on a killing spree, killing most of the villagers, along with his family, but kept him alive on one condition. Y'xor has to make an invention that is able to teleport more than one person and teleports them out of the planet.

Y'xor wanted to live life under the radar and had to start new, filled with sorrow and loneliness. While Y'Xor was living alone, a wanderer was traveling around Y'Xor's makeshift house. Y'Xor was anxious and thought it was the mercenaries. Y'Xor being paranoid, got a blade weapon and cautiously checked outside. The young child in front of him was curious and was picking crops from Y'Xor's garden, oblivious to who owns the land. Y'Xor noticed the child and the child reminded him of his son.

Aircraft survives and player lands on the base of where their house was located. All remnants of the house were mostly destroyed, with a few objects kept intact. One of the objects that remained was a safe. The player checks on the safe and surprisingly was unlocked. There was currency, valuables, and a folder. The folder held secrets to future plans of what Dad was working on, along with what Mom was working on. What was found out after looking through the items in the safe was a surprise, a secret that the parents hid from the now young adult had piqued interest. The interesting item in the safe happens to be a family photo. There was a stain on the family photo, covering a figure. While smudging off the stain, taking a closer inspection, it seemed to be another family member. The family member seemed to be around the same age as the teenager then. It was a shocking revelation to find out that there was another sibling, rather than being the only child. The young adult had many questions and feelings, some of which cannot be answered, due to deceased parents. Many questions rose: Why were they hiding the fact that I have a sibling?, Who is the sibling?, Why did I never meet them?, Why were they not a part of the family? The emotions of the young adult were racing, and completely stopped when a figure from the distance showed up. Why is there a figure? How did they survive the meteor? The figure looked mutilated and had a missing arm and nose. The young adult was shocked and cautiously backed away from the figure. The figure yells the young adult’s name. The young adult was left in confusion, whether to fight or be amicable and converse with the figure. The young adult did not know if the figure could be hostile. As the young adult was preparing to attack, the unknown figure comes closer. The figure says, “I’ve been looking for you, my long-lost sibling”. Whether the young believe what the unknown figure said, is still deciding on whether to fight the figure or talk to the figure.",
